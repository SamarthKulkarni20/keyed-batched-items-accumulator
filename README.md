- **Fixed-Size Batches**: Automatically manage items into batches of a specified size.
- **Preserved Order**: Maintain the insertion order of items within each key.
- **Streamlined Processing**: Process items in real-time, avoiding the need for post-processing 1D arrays.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, designed for performance.
- **TypeScript Support**: Written in TypeScript, offering type safety and better developer experience.

## Installation

To get started, install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install keyed-batched-items-accumulator
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the Keyed Batched Items Accumulator in your Node.js project.

```javascript
const { Accumulator } = require('keyed-batched-items-accumulator');

const accumulator = new Accumulator({
  batchSize: 5,
});

accumulator.on('batch', (key, items) => {
  console.log(`Batch for key ${key}:`, items);
});

// Add items to the accumulator
accumulator.add('key1', 'item1');
accumulator.add('key1', 'item2');
accumulator.add('key1', 'item3');
accumulator.add('key1', 'item4');
accumulator.add('key1', 'item5'); // This triggers the batch event
```

## API Reference

### `Accumulator`

#### `new Accumulator(options)`

Creates a new instance of the Accumulator.

**Parameters:**

- `options` (Object): Configuration options.
  - `batchSize` (Number): The maximum number of items in each batch.

#### `accumulator.add(key, item)`

Adds an item to the accumulator under the specified key.

**Parameters:**

- `key` (String): The key under which to accumulate the item.
- `item` (Any): The item to accumulate.

#### Events

- `batch(key, items)`: Emitted when a batch is ready for processing.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Usage

```javascript
const { Accumulator } = require('keyed-batched-items-accumulator');

const accumulator = new Accumulator({ batchSize: 3 });

accumulator.on('batch', (key, items) => {
  console.log(`Processed batch for ${key}:`, items);
});

accumulator.add('group1', 'a');
accumulator.add('group1', 'b');
accumulator.add('group1', 'c'); // Triggers batch
accumulator.add('group1', 'd');
```

### Example 2: Multiple Keys

```javascript
const { Accumulator } = require('keyed-batched-items-accumulator');

const accumulator = new Accumulator({ batchSize: 2 });

accumulator.on('batch', (key, items) => {
  console.log(`Batch for ${key}:`, items);
});

accumulator.add('groupA', '1');
accumulator.add('groupA', '2'); // Triggers batch
accumulator.add('groupB', 'X');
accumulator.add('groupB', 'Y'); // Triggers batch
```
